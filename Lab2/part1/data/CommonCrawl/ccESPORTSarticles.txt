ANAHEIM, Calif. -- A rainbow of strobe lights dances across the championship banners that line a walkway leading from an ordinary, brightly lit convention center lobby to a dark arena that feels like an alternate universe.
Dramatic theme music fills the air, as smoke from a machine dissipates to reveal a gamer’s heaven.
Oversized monitors in the rafters broadcast the action, and speakers boom with an intense amount of bass.
Then, a team delivers a final kill shot, and a crowd of several thousand erupts in cheers.

In the middle of this scene at the Call of Duty World League tournament is Los Angeles Rams offensive guard Rodger Saffold. He finished mandatory minicamp only the week prior, and he’s tending to his other job as owner of Rise Nation, an esports team that he founded in 2014, which boasts several of the top video game players and teams in the country.
“The lights are crazy; the energy is amazing,” said Saffold, who, at 6-foot-5 and 325 pounds, stood out among the crowd, wearing a black sweatshirt and a diamond-encrusted pendant with a Rise Nation logo. “It’s also very stressful.”
For six months a year, Saffold is strictly focused on football. But when the season ends, the nine-year NFL pro fills much of his time with gaming. He grew up loving puzzles. Then during college, he developed a penchant for video games, more specifically “Call of Duty,” the first-person-shooter game.
“I was streaming my [video game] play on Twitch,” Saffold said, referring to a live-streaming video platform. “Somebody gave me the idea that we should probably just come up with our own team, and I decided to make it from scratch.”
The structure of an esports organization bears a resemblance to an NFL team.
As the owner, Saffold funds the organization, “like a poor man’s Stan Kroenke,” he chuckled, in reference to the Rams’ owner. He has a partner in longtime friend Kareem Horsley and hired former gamer Jonathan Tucker as general manager.
“In big decisions, we keep him informed,” said Tucker, who first met Saffold in 2014 at a gaming tournament. “Transfers, signings, big-money moves that could affect how we work, we have to consult him. ... But as far as day-to-day stuff, me and Kareem do most of it, because it’s just too many things to bother him with.”
Saffold, who studied business management at Indiana, has 10 full-time employees and a roster that fluctuates between 10 and 12 players among seven teams, depending on the games and tournaments the organization is involved in.
To develop his business, Saffold leaned on the friendships he developed within the esports industry. “Just picking everybody’s brain,” Saffold said, “we were kind of able to figure out a formula.”
He also sought the creative input of a Rams graphic designer to develop a Rise Nation logo.
“I wanted to be involved and invested into something that I have a lot of passion for,” Saffold said. “This seemed to be it.”
Saffold isn’t the only person from professional sports getting into gaming. Earlier this year, the NBA became the first professional sports league to operate an esports league when it launched NBA 2K, which features some of the best basketball gamers in the world.
Magic Johnson, Shaquille O’Neal, Rick Fox, Alex Rodriguez and Jimmy Rollins are among former athletes who have invested in esports.
But Saffold is one of only two current professional athlete to own an organization, something he takes pride in.
“I’m making money at it,” Saffold said. “But at the same time, I started off with ‘Call of Duty’ and now I’ve ventured into different games and different sports, and we kind of developed a nice community of people surrounded by Rise that just enjoy the organization that we created.”
His gamer tag is Rise Blindside, and, during the offseason, Saffold can often be found huddled in front of three screens inside his game room at home, competing against friends and Rise Nation players.
“He is so supportive and so engaged,” said Daniel Loza, a member of Rise Nation’s Call of Duty team. “It’s not just a business thing, like you play for me. He gets to know you, know what you like. ... I’ve played [Call of Duty] before with him. I’ve played games with him. ... He’s a gamer, so he understands.”
At the Call of Duty World League tournament in Anaheim, fans in Rise Nation jerseys stopped Saffold for photos and autographs.
“At first they’re like, ‘Oh man, there goes the Rise Nation owner,’” Saffold said. “Then they’re like ‘Oh, it’s a Rams football player.’ ... So I’ve had autographs for my gamer tag as well as for football.”
But when his team took the controls, Saffold became all but unapproachable. His eyes were fixated on the screen as he hardly blinked.

“This is about to get serious!” he said to no one in particular, when his team heated up after a slow start. “This is going to be close. Wow, that shot was ridiculous. ... Let’s go!”
The running commentary continued until his team completed a come-from-behind win in the first game and swept the match. Following the victory, he quietly made his way to another screen to scout future opponents. Even during a meal break, Saffold clutched his phone to watch the action online.
“Before I got started with this, I was a fan,” Saffold said. “I wasn’t a corporation trying to just get into esports. ... So being able to come to these things and just watch game play, because as a gamer, I watch these guys, and I’m picking up tips.”
Tucker said it was rare to see an owner as involved as Saffold.
“He likes games,” Tucker said. “So it’s a lot different to come sit around all day with everybody.”
The four-member Rise Nation Call of Duty team has won three tournaments this season, including its most recent in Anaheim, where it took home $80,000 of a $200,000 prize pool.
Rise Nation's team is the favorite going into the Call of Duty World League Championship in Columbus, Ohio, in August, where the prize pool will increase to $1.5 million.
“Definitely want that world championship for Call of Duty,” Saffold said. “It puts us at another notch and just that premier level. ... We’ve got a pretty decent following, but I think grabbing a world championship would take us over the top.”
And other Rams want to get involved.
Saffold won’t reveal any names. He’s not ready to expand the business yet and doesn’t want to tip other teams to potential investors or owners when they could one day help him grow Rise Nation.
“At first we were thinking this was more of a hobby,” Saffold said. “But now it has kind of grown, and having more than one team and having players from all over the world has really been shocking thus far. We’re only five years into this.”As the world of eSports continues to evolve, video game designers are starting to emulate sports leagues to provide pro players and fans the biggest spectacle possible.
Take Riot Games’ “League of Legends,” for instance. The online multiplayer battle arena game is such a phenomenon worldwide, matches are telecast in Korea during prime time and attract as many as four million viewers per week. Gamers from 145 countries worldwide hack and slash each other on a daily basis, the pro tournaments attract as many as four million streaming viewers at a time in the U.S. and Europe, and there are even a handful of gamers out there who have been able to quit their day jobs and actually play “League of Legends” as their full-time job.
And this week, Riot Games announced that they are upping the ante, offering not only prize money for tournament winners, but salaries for professional gamers who make up the best teams around the world and take on their new season format, complete with playoffs and a championship.
Oh, and did I mention the $5 million in prize money?
I caught up with Riot Games' CEO, Brandon Beck, for more on this PC phenomenon.
ESPN Playbook: For sports gamers wrapped up in “Madden” and “FIFA,” can you tell them what they are missing out by not playing “League of Legends”? Why is this game such a huge deal in competitive gaming?
Brandon Beck: What’s really exciting about “League of Legends” is that the game was built from the ground up to be a sport. It’s a competitive, five-on-five, team-based experience and it is played in 35- to 45-minute matches. And the reason people are playing “League of Legends” months and years after they start is not because they are advancing through some sort of linear storyline. It’s the same reason you play any other sport, and that’s to work on your game and get better because no two games are the same.
With teams now playing a full season, playoffs, and a championship in “League of Legends” season three, which was just announced this week, it sounds like you’re attempting to bridge that gap between sports and eSports like never before.
"League of Legends" is a 5-on-5 competition on the PC that's quickly rising in popularity. Riot Games
Because our fans and our players are so keen on watching the pros play and seeing the highest level of the game being played, that enables us to really make an investment in building out the sport. Watching the games has become such an integral part of the experience, and to take eSports from where they are today to where we want to go, is to add a broadcast experience, a live-event experience that has the same quality as pro sports. We have to really invest in evolving eSports.
In 2013, players are not only going to win prize money for winning tournaments, but gamers are going to be paid salaries to compete on teams. How much will the average salary be?
In season three, which is our next season, and it will follow our World Championships in October, the champion of the series, which is in a professional league, is going to have salaries. The salaries are there to cover the basic cost of living for players, and they’re going to be augmented by stipends that cover things like travel and housing, which is all meant to compliment the sponsor revenue players can make and the cash prizes for the tournament. All of that combined makes being a professional “League of Legends” player a viable career opportunity. This helps the game reach its full potential, because we want to avoid our pro players coming under financial stress and having to hold down part-time jobs. We want to make it so being a pro player is a completely viable career opportunity.
So if you’re the top “League of Legends” player, how much money are we talking about?
The prize pool in season two is $5 million, and the top team will make a substantial cut of that prize pool. Couple that with all of the other opportunities, it’s quite significant.
So how many people out there do you see playing “League of Legends” as a profession come season three in 2013?
In the champion series, there are leagues by region (North America, Europe, and Asia), and each region has eight pro teams. A typical team is made up of five to six players. The upcoming regional finals that we are having in season two are also going to help determine which teams are going to get automatic seeds into the championship series for season three. So it’s going to be really exciting to watch our North American finals and our European finals, which are at PAX and Gamescom this year.
When you look at professional gamers and eSports players, do you consider them athletes in their own regard?
The best "League of Legends" players are paid well enough for gaming to be their full-time job. Riot Games
In our minds, they are athletes. To be a pro gamer, you have to possess tremendous manual dexterity and mental agility and toughness, and that’s akin to certain characteristics that other professional athletes have. There’s also a massive amount of team play, so these guys have to be phenomenal team players and phenomenal leaders, and they have to have an unbreakable competitive spirit just like any pro athlete has. A pro gamer’s dexterity is measured in actions per minute, and it’s phenomenal to watch pro gamers actually up there playing. Watching their hands and watching their teamwork is really exciting. That’s why you go to these pro gaming events and you’ll see an audience full of fans who are as riveted by the action as you would see at any conventional sport.
How many hours per day do the top “League of Legends” players spend on the game?
Many of the pro teams are living in game houses together, and they’re spending 12 to 14 hours a day practicing. They’re also spending time in the gym to make sure they’re in great physical shape as well. They spend the rest of the time eating, sleeping, and bonding as a team.
How many people would you say play the game on a daily basis?
Last time we announced numbers was last fall, and we had over 11 million monthly active players, and we’ve seen significant growth since then, so it’s a large number.
But we’re really, really fired up to see the competition play out in the coming months. We’re making our way to the most exciting part of our season where now, the best teams from around the world are fighting for those few spots in the global world championships. Come October, we’re going to see the best teams go head-to-head, and it’s going to be phenomenal. It’s a sports arena filled with screaming fans getting fired-up about epic competition and the two best teams battling it out in a video game. It’s a really cool experience.ANAHEIM, Calif. -- A rainbow of strobe lights dances across the championship banners that line a walkway leading from an ordinary, brightly lit convention center lobby to a dark arena that feels like an alternate universe.

We’re only five years into this.”Last Thanksgiving, Dan Kaufman was having one of the many routine family discussions that tend to fill up a holiday weekend. This one was with his 17-year-old nephew, who was discussing a topic familiar to many male teenagers -- his love of video games.
"He was saying, ‘I wish I could go pro, but I’m not good enough,'" said Kaufman, senior deputy editor for content development for ESPN.com.
The response of many adults to that lament would likely have been some combination of discouragement and eye rolling. Kaufman’s reply was different. He discussed the explosion of esports and the professional opportunities that have come from that rise.
When he was done, Kaufman paused, looked at his nephew, and said, "I bet this is the first time you’ve talked to someone over the age of 30 who didn’t just say, 'Why are you wasting your time on this?'"
"Yes," was the sheepish reply.
Kaufman’s nephew isn’t alone in his desire. In the past few years, while parents around the world have continued telling their kids to put down the joysticks and go outside, esports has become a mega-business, one projected by games research firm Newzoo to surpass $1 billion in revenues by 2019 and heavily engaged with the prized 25- to 34-year-old male demographic.
Why was Kaufman more sage than most his age about its potential? He is heading up the ESPN digital content team’s aggressive push into esports.
The network’s embrace of esports has not come without critics, internal and external. Then ESPN radio host Colin Cowherd, now with Fox Sports, trashed the network’s coverage of esports on his show in April 2015. Some readers have complained to me that because it happens on a screen and not a field, esports falls outside what ESPN should be covering.
But esports is merely one example of the network’s investment into coverage areas it had historically neglected. In the past year, ESPN also has increased its coverage of gambling, drone racing and WWE, among other topics. Each has generated some dissension among the ranks of ESPN consumers. According to some readers, these new coverage areas are either not really sports (esports and drone racing), immoral (gambling) or about a fake sport (WWE).
But each is an attempt by ESPN to engage new audiences against the backdrop of an ever-fragmenting sports landscape that has created business challenges for the network. (Of the new areas, only the WWE raises red flags for me, to be addressed in a separate column).
Specific to esports, here are a few numbers to digest as you consider ESPN’s approach.
According to Newzoo, professional gaming is projected to generate $463 million in revenue in 2016 and will surpass a billion dollars in revenue by 2019.
According to SuperDataResearch, another gaming research firm, the worldwide market for esports includes 134 million participants annually.
The esports audience is made up primarily of young men. Nearly half are men between the ages of 21 and 35 -- a coveted marketing demographic -- according to a 2014 joint report from SuperData and Newzoo.
A January article in VentureBeat cites a Newzoo report that predicts esports audiences could reach NFL viewership levels by 2017.
That same VentureBeat article also reported that the League Championship Series had an average concurrent viewership of 4.2 million through its final event. That usage peaked at 14 million. “These are massive numbers that compare favorably to the playoffs for traditional sports like NCAA basketball, Major League Baseball, and the National Basketball Association,” the story said.
Although the demographics and business opportunities for esports are crucial, ESPN’s ability to televise esports might be the most important element, as it looks to lock up as many live events as it can to maintain its position in an ever time-shifted world.
So while ESPN’s esports investment seems to make business sense, that doesn’t mean it came easily. It was a process, one that required persistence from business executives and evolution from the newsroom. And along the way, there was no shortage of skeptics, including a very important one: the guy who runs the company.
"It’s not a sport -- it’s a competition," ESPN President John Skipper famously said of esports at a 2014 conference. “Chess is a competition. Checkers is a competition. Mostly, I’m interested in doing real sports."
But to ESPN’s credit, that statement didn’t stop some from continuing to advocate for a focus on esports. Internally, John Kosner, ESPN’s executive vice president of digital and print media, and Cliff Shoemaker, the network’s senior manager of interactive games and partnerships, were among those who kept pushing Skipper on the value of the business opportunity.
Meanwhile, momentum was starting to build within ESPN’s news operation. While the network had been dabbling in esports -- it broadcast the 2014 League of Legends World Championship and Blizzard’s collegiate Heroes of the Storm tournament, called Heroes of the Dorm -- there was little to no editorial coverage of esports on its platforms. That started to change at a brainstorming meeting held at ESPN The Magazine in June 2014. Among the ideas pitched to Chad Millman -- then editor-in-chief of the magazine and now vice president and editorial director of domestic digital content -- was a dedicated esports issue of the magazine.
After some discussion, Millman gave the idea a green light, saying later "It just seemed like esports was having its moment."
Even with that decision, the key moment for Millman came when he started reading the stories filed for the esports issue. Said Millman, "They were so good. As I was reading Mina Kimes' article [on South Korean esports prodigy Faker], I was getting butterflies. It told the story of this business through one particular person and explained the scope of the opportunity."
Before that issue even hit the stands last June, Millman had already scribbled down “esports” on his whiteboard as a subject to tackle more aggressively. Which leads us back to Kaufman.
"I was spending time with Chad looking at his whiteboard, and I saw one line: ‘Daily fantasy, Gambling and esports," Kaufman recalls. "I said, 'I have daily fantasy and gambling [as part of his editorial oversight]. Who’s doing e-sports?'"
Two weeks later, Kaufman was asked whether he wanted to do it. His reply?
"'I don’t know anything about [esports], but yes,'" he said. "I have always liked the experience of starting with a white sheet of paper."
The investment in coverage on the digital and print sides led to the event that turned an increasing editorial interest into a full-blown, networkwide push. Attending the League of Legends North American Championships at Madison Square Garden this past August, Skipper and a large group of ESPN executives were overwhelmed by the energy of the event and the response of the audience.
"It was a wow event," Skipper said. "I saw that it mattered to lots of fans. Fans drive what we do, and these events matter to them. And we like trying new things."
"They understood the relationship of the fan to what they were watching," Kaufman said. "We have come to understand the relationship of esports fans to their events. It may not be a stick-and-ball sport, but the fans root just as passionately. And the numbers are just gigantic."
And don’t overlook ESPN executives’ constant use of the word “fans” because it comes up almost any time you talk to anyone at the network. Based on six months of meetings with various ESPN employees, it is clear that the company’s focus is not on those who cover ESPN but on those who consume the network’s content across various platforms. This is why the inevitable question -- are esports really sports -- is met more with a sigh than anything else.
"I don’t think it matters," Millman said. "Esports are interesting to a huge group of people who are highly competitive. ... If we keep trying to get caught up in defining what a ‘sport’ is, we get in our own way. ... It’s our job to serve fans the best we can."
Adds Kaufman: "When you get past the idea you’re looking at a screen, it’s like sports. You are looking at a live experience."
Once ESPN made the decision to invest in esports coverage, the next question became how Millman and Kaufman -- admittedly, two esports neophytes -- would be able to build something relevant to the deeply committed. Business and demographic opportunities mean little if the eventual product doesn’t resonate. So, once the commitment was made this past fall to launch an esports vertical, they went in search of experts.
"Ten percent of the audience is incredibly knowledgeable about what you are covering, and you have to get the nuance right," Millman said of the challenge of being authentic. "If they trash what you’re doing, the next level of readers will not buy into it."
Among those who had noticed ESPN’s new esports commitment was Darin Kwilinski, then managing editor at esports site Azubu. Despite being worried he was underqualified, Kwilinski applied and soon got a call from Kaufman. He received the offer to edit the new esports vertical on his way home on the same Thanksgiving weekend in which Kaufman would be impressing his nephew with his knowledge of esports.
Skipper's earlier public dismissal of esports made no difference in Kwilinski's decision. "That specific comment never really bothered me. Brands change strategies and goals," he said.
That said, Kwilinski is glad ESPN saw the light, saying, "The industry -- with or without ESPN -- was going to move forward. The pressure finally became big enough, and they turned their head, saw how big it was and jumped in."
Kwilinski also makes a point that many have forgotten -- or maybe never knew: The "E" in "ESPN" originally stood for "entertainment," and the network has a long history of covering events that might fall closer to that category than sports. Those have included poker, strongest-man competitions, Scrabble tournaments, spelling bees, bass fishing and plenty more.
But, in fairness, only a few of those subject areas ever led to a standalone vertical within ESPN’s digital properties, which makes ESPN’s commitment to esports more significant.
Since launching that vertical on Jan. 14, ESPN has added resources, and will soon have a staff of five. Though he didn’t provide the raw numbers, Kaufman says April was the vertical’s best month ever, with a 58 percent increase in traffic over March. Nearly 70 percent of that traffic was referred via social media.
And if you’re looking for another reason ESPN had made such a commitment to esports, process this paragraph from VentureBeat's article:
Traditional sports are losing interest, and it doesn’t look like that’s going to turn around. Fewer high school-aged kids are participating in sports. Starting in 2008 and continuing through 2012, football saw a 5.4 percent drop in players from 3.26 million to 3.08 million. And they aren’t going to soccer, baseball, or basketball — those sports saw declines of 7.1 percent, 7.2 percent, and 8.3 percent, respectively. Only lacrosse is growing, but it isn’t making up the difference for what the other sports are losing.
This is why I think the esports move makes sense for ESPN. Big media companies generally have lousy track records when it comes to looking around the bend, but the network is trying to do just that by investing here. Esports is already a huge business, and it’s getting larger by the day. With the decline in participation in traditional stick-and-ball sports, ESPN needs to place some chips elsewhere.
Does that guarantee success? No. The drop in participation levels among traditional sports doesn’t necessarily mean the number of fans of those sports will decline. And yes, esports could be having, as Millman says, its moment, and it could be fleeting. That, though, seems unlikely.
Either way, it’s a smart play. In a world in which ESPN’s business model is being significantly affected by the fragmentation of media, the network isn’t wasting time trying to change consumer behavior. Instead, it’s going where a new generation of consumers awaits.One of the things that has always stood out about ESPN is its willingness to experiment on the digital front. While far too many legacy media companies still look for reasons not to try new things, ESPN has always seemed game to experiment.
Snapchat is one of the areas in which that experimentation has borne fruit, thanks to a large team at ESPN committed to it, the network’s willingness to continue to adapt its approach and a strong partnership with the social media company. The latest big shift was the network’s November decision to replace its previous magazine-like Snapchat Discover approach with a mini-SportsCenter Snapchat “show” that runs twice every weekday and once on weekends.
ESPN and Snap Inc. -- the name of the company that operates Snapchat -- signed a two-year contract for the new show, and the companies will split the ad revenue that comes from it. This is clearly an attempt to attract younger consumers as part of ESPN’s push into an unbundled, multiplatform world.
The Snapchat SportsCenter debuted Nov. 13, and it features a tone that’s a little lighter and less structured than the broadcast version, featuring a brisk pace and fast-twitch editing used to pack as much information as possible into its short run time.
A recent edition from December featured anchor Treavor Scales running through NBA highlights from the night before, discussing NBA social media trash talk and making a few dad jokes about some of the odder college football bowl names. The latter segment featured cut-ins of Alabama football coach Nick Saban expressing various news conference emotions that ESPN felt reflected the quality of the individual dad jokes. And all in 7 minutes and 4 seconds.
Overall, it’s a nice, breezy product, though certainly not one that would satisfy the obsessive needs of a devoted sports fan on a daily basis. But that’s not the point of the Snapchat SportsCenter offering. It’s designed for a content grazer with a short attention span, and, to that end, the product meets the consumer need.
According to Nate Ravitz, ESPN’s vice president of audience development, one of the reasons the Snapchat relationship has been successful is because both sides have been fully engaged since the partnership began.
“Snapchat has been an exceptional partner in working on this project together,” he said. “They created a totally custom CMS, improved it over time, and have been receptive to feedback. ... It’s night and day from three years ago to what we have today. They’ve been terrific.”
The Snapchat SportsCenter show is getting more than 2 million unique visitors per day, and, according to ESPN, 75 percent of viewers are between the ages of 13 and 24.
When ESPN launched on Snapchat Discover in January 2015, it was limited to using static images, but that soon changed.
“It went from static images to the Ken Burns effect [the panning in and out of static images] to these images that can move,” Ravitz said. “We had questions about whether we could do video or not, or whether we could use audio or run something with sound behind it. That all started to happen in the fall [of 2015].”
The integration of video and sound changed the way Ravitz viewed the project, and he says, “I didn’t really get it until the segments that had movement in it. It kind of turned from a quaint side project into something that could be transformative.”
The relationship continued to develop, and new features -- such as allowing readers into the channel via multiple entry points -- were added. This meant that if, on one visit, a viewer watched the first three snaps, he or she would start at the fourth snap upon return, eliminating the need to rewatch the first three segments.
The Snapchat experiment has also helped ESPN envision how to function in an increasingly mobile world, with Ravitz saying, “We’ve seen the transition from print to digital, and desktop to mobile. Snapchat was the first thing that was mobile only.
“I came to feel very strongly that only producing for a phone and a vertical screen with a forced deadline required a different level of creativity.”
Policy change seemingly reducing attribution battles
Of the myriad issues ESPN has to deal with in the 24/7 news cycle, attribution of scoops has been one of the thorniest. The intersection where desire for journalistic credit and intense professional rivalries meet is frequently contentious.
ESPN has received a fair amount of criticism around its attribution policies, and there were plenty of cases in which it was well-deserved. For many years, when another media outlet reported something first, that organization would be credited only for as long as it took ESPN to confirm that report -- even when it was clear ESPN wouldn’t have been working to confirm had the original report not been published.
At other times, the much-maligned phrase “media reports” would be used as attribution on ESPN platforms. This occurred in cases where multiple outlets had confirmed a story, even if there was one organization that clearly had the information first.
Intentional or not, these attribution policies led to many public battles over the years, and gave the impression that ESPN was reluctant to give credit to other journalistic organizations. Previous ESPN ombudsmen have also written about these struggles with attribution.
Of course, attribution isn’t just an ESPN issue; plenty of reporters and executives at ESPN feel the same tactics have been used against the network when it broke stories.
When you’re the biggest player in the space, though, it’s up to you to set the rules of proper behavior. If you won’t lead, you can’t ask others to follow.
So it’s to ESPN’s credit that, in mid-2016, the company rewrote its attribution guidelines. After watching them in action for 18 months, they seem to have made a positive impact. That’s not to say there aren’t still squabbles about credit snatching or labeling, but the volume of complaints seems to have receded, at least the ones within public view.
The source of previous attribution controversies centered on two questions:
How did ESPN handle stories that had been broken by someone else but that ESPN had not yet confirmed? What did ESPN do once it had confirmed a story broken by another organization?
On No. 1, the first decision was whether to run the story, which depended on the reputation of the news organization and/or reporter who broke the news and the subject matter of the story. For example, a report about a trade rumor or an injury update was more likely to be run than one involving a more serious off-the-field issue -- for which the risk of running without independent confirmation was much greater.
Assuming the story was one ESPN was comfortable running, the question then became how to source the information. Historically, the network would have used “media reports” or similar phrasing. But the new guidelines require the network to reference the original source of the information, which is a big step in the right direction. Even better, it requires use of the phrase “first reported by,” which is clearer and more transparent than “according to.” This means that, if a story is broken by another news organization, that fact is referenced as long as ESPN is reporting that story. This is good, and proper.
In the past, once the credited story was published, ESPN would go to work on independently confirming it. Assuming it did, ESPN would then substitute its confirmation in place of the organization that had originally broken the story. This meant it was possible for someone to break a story and have ESPN only briefly -- and, in some cases, never -- mention the originating organization’s name.
But the new guidelines mandate that, even after ESPN’s independent confirmation, any graphic shown on the air should continue to carry the “first reported by” language, assuring the originating organization the credit it deserves. In the online version of that story, using Fox Sports as an example, ESPN would use the language “first reported by Fox Sports and confirmed by ESPN.” This is appropriate.
David Kraft, ESPN’s executive editor of news operations, said the new guidelines have been successful: “it’s more easily understood and implemented, and we think it’s been equitable to all concerned. Like any set of guidelines, it’s sometimes open to interpretation and some discussion, but we think we’re fair, straightforward and transparent, which has always been the goal of our attribution policies.”
Said Seth Markman, ESPN’s senior NFL coordinating producer: “I think getting rid of ‘media reports’ is good. It’s OK to say Fox Sports or NFL.com was the first to report something. I think there was some reluctance in the past. It was too easy for us to say a bunch of networks had it.”
The term “multiple reports” isn’t totally dead. It’s still used in cases in which multiple outlets break a story within a few minutes of each other, often in cases in which a player, agent or front-office executive is passing the word of some development to multiple reporters.
The new guidelines seem to have reduced the noise over how ESPN handles attribution, at least based on the reduced number of Twitter flare-ups and stories written off of those public squabbles.
“I have not heard very much on this, which tells me it is working,” said Adam Schefter, an ESPN senior NFL writer who lives most of his days at the epicenter of the get-it-first battles. “It’s like playing offensive line in the NFL: the less you hear, the better you are faring.”
Schefter also thinks ESPN has historically done a better job on attribution than it has gotten credit for.
“ESPN has always done a better job of crediting people with stories than others,” he said. “The policy in the past was not perfect. The new policy was meant to make improvements, to get them the credit, as we should. Before, I thought ESPN was doing a good job, and now I think we’re doing a better job at that. In fact, I think it does a better job than anyone else.”
Everyone I talked to at ESPN about this issue made it clear that there are no perfect attribution policies and that missteps will happen. That’s true. But committing to naming the originating news organization reduces that margin of error, as painful as it might be to an ESPN reporter who gets beat. Then again, that same reporter would expect other news organizations to show the same consideration were the situations reversed.
Markman said he likes the new policy and wishes some of the network’s competitors would follow suit.
“If Jay Glazer had a story and Adam or Mort [Chris Mortensen] confirmed that, we would put ‘ESPN and Fox Sports,’” he said. “I never thought that was perfect, giving credit but putting yourself first. Now, we say ‘first reported by Fox Sports.’ But I don’t see ‘first reported by ESPN [on other networks].’”
One thing you can count on when discussing attribution is that, whatever the policy and however closely an organization adheres to it, the trash-talking will never stop. And what else would you expect from ultracompetitive journalists?
ESPN still grappling with wrestling, but flying with esports
I’ve previously written about ESPN’s decisions to roll out dedicated sections for esports and WWE. While I was fully in support of the esports launch, I was dubious about the viability of WWE coverage because of its awkward fit into the hard news side of ESPN’s operation.
As my term nears its end, I decided to check in with Dan Kaufman, the ESPN senior deputy editor who oversees both verticals. After talking to him and reviewing the content and coverage of both verticals, I stand by my earlier conclusions. Esports has continued to grow dramatically as an industry; ESPN’s coverage has been lauded by outsiders, even winning a prestigious coverage award; and traffic continues to grow at a slow-but-steady pace. Meanwhile, according to Kaufman, ESPN’s WWE traffic has remained flat, and the challenges of coverage were highlighted by its coverage -- or lack thereof -- of a bullying scandal that hit WWE earlier this year.
“Wrestling has been more of a challenge than esports,” Kaufman put it succinctly.
Much of the focus of my 2016 WWE column concerned the difficulty of taking professional wrestling -- with much of the action scripted -- and inserting it into an operation that covers unscripted sports. But that hasn’t been the problem Kaufman has experienced. The real challenge?
“We’re never going to be the place for the hard-core wrestling fan,” he said.
Part of the reason for that is that there are still many inside ESPN who aren’t sure how much the network should be committing to this effort.
“It’s fair to say that, right from the start, there were execs who were conflicted about [covering WWE],” Kaufman said. “It doesn’t feel like, to a lot of them, something we should be doing.”
Many of those skeptics reside on the news side of ESPN’s operation, which, as I noted in my piece, is a handicap for the WWE vertical, since traffic growth for any section relies on the high-profile promotion that ESPN.com’s news pages can provide. And the policy about cautiously treating WWE as “news” means that most of the promotion wrestling has gotten in the news space has come when a well-known wrestler has died.
“I think the audience has been steady, and the big things we’ve done have hit well,” Kaufman said. “The baseline [on traffic] really hasn’t moved that much, but we’re providing content for an audience we know is there.”
But, back in April, there was one story that wasn’t covered on the WWE page that got many in the wrestling community fired up. That was when then-SmackDown Live host John Bradshaw Layfield was accused of being a serial bully over his 20 years at WWE.
The controversy was triggered when Layfield criticized colleague Mauro Ranallo for missing a broadcast. Ranallo, as it turns out, had missed the broadcast because he was suffering from bipolar disorder, which Ranallo said had been partially triggered by Rayfield’s bullying. While the news was the talk of professional wrestling media for a few weeks, ESPN’s WWE vertical didn’t report on it, and then-ESPN personality Jonathan Coachman -- who had previously worked for WWE for nine years -- downplayed the story via social media. The fact the story wasn’t being covered and was even downplayed bothered others who cover professional wrestling, and readers such as Henk Mulder, who wrote:
ESPN is reporting on WWE, which is something that I applauded. But, the stories on the ESPN.com website are pretty much storyline based and real news on WWE is ignored. A well-respected organization like ESPN should either bring all the WWE news or no news at all. The JBL-Mauro Ranallo situation being just one of [those stories], a very real story with a guy quitting his dream job because of the bully culture in WWE… This just shows money and being good with WWE is more important to ESPN than telling a very real and impactful story about WWE.
One of the few mentions of the scandal on an ESPN platform came when WWE’s Pete Rosenberg, host of ESPN’s Cheap Heat podcast, referenced it. And even that small bit of coverage generated controversy, as detailed by the Dayton Daily News’ B.J. Bethel at the time:
Pete Rosenberg hosts ESPN’s Cheap Heat podcast on its WWE page, and hosts a show on WWE’s streaming service with frequent guest John Layfield, the central figure in the Ranallo controversy. It was Rosenberg’s show where Layfield tore into Ranallo for acknowledging a Wrestling Observer award he won, among the many times he ripped Ranallo. So to this point of the scandal, ESPN’s only serious acknowledgment of the incident is by someone with no credibility and plenty of conflict of interest because he works for the company they allegedly cover.
That controversy isn’t the only sign that covering WWE isn’t a major priority for ESPN. This spring, SportsCenter stopped running the weekly WWE segment once done by Coachman. Then, in November, Coachman -- a high-profile WWE supporter -- left the company. In a tweet, he suggested ESPN ended the segment because it was too popular.
Kaufman declined comment on the bullying controversy, as much of it occurred on platforms outside of his purview. That said, the fact the WWE vertical didn’t cover the story was notable, and not in a good way.
All this would seem to augur an unpredictable future for ESPN’s WWE coverage. To me, it remains an uncomfortable fit inside a news organization, especially if the coverage isn’t helping ESPN find a new audience.
The network’s esports coverage hasn’t seen the same challenges, and Kaufman says he’s proud of the work his team has done there.
“We wanted to find the right people, the right writers and bring ESPN-style reporting to the space, and I think we’ve done that,” he said. “We’re less than two years in at a nonendemic media company, and I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished. ... The support from the company has been outstanding.”
In November, ESPN’s esports vertical was named Coverage Website of the Year at the Annual Esports Industry Awards. On Nov. 28 and 29, ESPN and Twitch partnered for a 24-hour live streaming broadcast to support the Jimmy V Foundation. And Kaufman now has six full-time staffers working on esports.
ESPN’s success here is more notable because, despite the popularity of esports, it hasn’t been a great few months for sites that cover it: Yahoo closed its esports site in June, and Slingshot shut down in October.
The integration into ESPN’s more traditional news products isn’t a challenge for esports. While it’s certainly not a staple on SportsCenter or the network’s talk shows, when there’s a reason to cover esports, there are no ethical challenges in doing so. ESPN’s Arash Markazi did a SportsCenter report in October while covering the League of Legends World Championship in Shanghai. (Markazi’s presence in Shanghai also allowed him to shift gears when three UCLA men’s basketball players were arrested on shoplifting charges).
It’s clear to anyone who studies esports that it’s a revenue and audience opportunity for ESPN, even if it’ll always face critics who claim it’s not really a sport. But based on some of the unbundling challenges the network faces, it’s hard to argue against ESPN chasing new audiences and subject areas. This one looks like one of the most promising.A new law in Nevada will allow pari-mutuel wagering on the World Series of Poker, esports competitions and other nontraditional sporting events.
The bill, SB 240, was signed into law by Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval on Saturday after being unanimously approved by the Nevada Senate and Assembly. The law will be effective starting July 1.
"By adding 'other events', we are able to capture events like esports and the World Series of Poker," sponsoring Sen. Becky Harris of District 9 told ESPN. "This allows for Nevada operators to use a pari-mutuel system of wagering. This allows for operators to offer bets they might not otherwise make."
The bill was proposed to amend the 464th chapter of Nevada Statutes, which covers pari-mutuel betting. Prior to its approval, traditional sportsbook-style betting had been allowed on other events. The law will now open new lines for other competitions not classified under the traditional Nevada sporting events and dog racing law.
The difference between the two styles of betting is that pari-mutuel wagering allows gamblers to bet against one another, rather than against a bookmaker, therefore removing tax and the house take. The pari-mutuel matchmaker takes a percentage, with the remainder being divided among the winning bettors.
The news comes after successful sportsbook-style betting in many other events. Sportsbooks first opened betting for the final hand of the World Series of Poker in 2011. The Nevada Gaming Control Board has also approved sportsbook betting in 2016 for esports competitions Intel Extreme Masters Oakland and later DreamHack Masters Las Vegas in 2017.ANAHEIM, Calif. -- A rainbow of strobe lights dances across the championship banners that line a walkway leading from an ordinary, brightly lit convention center lobby to a dark arena that feels like an alternate universe.
Dramatic theme music fills the air, as smoke from a machine dissipates to reveal a gamer’s heaven.
Oversized monitors in the rafters broadcast the action, and speakers boom with an intense amount of bass.
Then, a team delivers a final kill shot, and a crowd of several thousand erupts in cheers.
Best of NFL Nation • Can Seahawks reload the L.O.B.?
• Washington's identity might mean defensive pick
• Flacco out to prove he can still do it
• Jeff Legwold's top 100 draft prospects
• NFL draft: Mock drafts, prospects and more
In the middle of this scene at the Call of Duty World League tournament is Los Angeles Rams offensive guard Rodger Saffold. He finished mandatory minicamp only the week prior, and he’s tending to his other job as owner of Rise Nation, an esports team that he founded in 2014, which boasts several of the top video game players and teams in the country.
“The lights are crazy; the energy is amazing,” said Saffold, who, at 6-foot-5 and 325 pounds, stood out among the crowd, wearing a black sweatshirt and a diamond-encrusted pendant with a Rise Nation logo. “It’s also very stressful.”
For six months a year, Saffold is strictly focused on football. But when the season ends, the nine-year NFL pro fills much of his time with gaming. He grew up loving puzzles. Then during college, he developed a penchant for video games, more specifically “Call of Duty,” the first-person-shooter game.
“I was streaming my [video game] play on Twitch,” Saffold said, referring to a live-streaming video platform. “Somebody gave me the idea that we should probably just come up with our own team, and I decided to make it from scratch.”
The structure of an esports organization bears a resemblance to an NFL team.
As the owner, Saffold funds the organization, “like a poor man’s Stan Kroenke,” he chuckled, in reference to the Rams’ owner. He has a partner in longtime friend Kareem Horsley and hired former gamer Jonathan Tucker as general manager.
“In big decisions, we keep him informed,” said Tucker, who first met Saffold in 2014 at a gaming tournament. “Transfers, signings, big-money moves that could affect how we work, we have to consult him. ... But as far as day-to-day stuff, me and Kareem do most of it, because it’s just too many things to bother him with.”
Saffold, who studied business management at Indiana, has 10 full-time employees and a roster that fluctuates between 10 and 12 players among seven teams, depending on the games and tournaments the organization is involved in.
To develop his business, Saffold leaned on the friendships he developed within the esports industry. “Just picking everybody’s brain,” Saffold said, “we were kind of able to figure out a formula.”
He also sought the creative input of a Rams graphic designer to develop a Rise Nation logo.
“I wanted to be involved and invested into something that I have a lot of passion for,” Saffold said. “This seemed to be it.”
Saffold isn’t the only person from professional sports getting into gaming. Earlier this year, the NBA became the first professional sports league to operate an esports league when it launched NBA 2K, which features some of the best basketball gamers in the world.
Magic Johnson, Shaquille O’Neal, Rick Fox, Alex Rodriguez and Jimmy Rollins are among former athletes who have invested in esports.
But Saffold is one of only two current professional athlete to own an organization, something he takes pride in.
“I’m making money at it,” Saffold said. “But at the same time, I started off with ‘Call of Duty’ and now I’ve ventured into different games and different sports, and we kind of developed a nice community of people surrounded by Rise that just enjoy the organization that we created.”
His gamer tag is Rise Blindside, and, during the offseason, Saffold can often be found huddled in front of three screens inside his game room at home, competing against friends and Rise Nation players.
“He is so supportive and so engaged,” said Daniel Loza, a member of Rise Nation’s Call of Duty team. “It’s not just a business thing, like you play for me. He gets to know you, know what you like. ... I’ve played [Call of Duty] before with him. I’ve played games with him. ... He’s a gamer, so he understands.”
At the Call of Duty World League tournament in Anaheim, fans in Rise Nation jerseys stopped Saffold for photos and autographs.
“At first they’re like, ‘Oh man, there goes the Rise Nation owner,’” Saffold said. “Then they’re like ‘Oh, it’s a Rams football player.’ ... So I’ve had autographs for my gamer tag as well as for football.”
But when his team took the controls, Saffold became all but unapproachable. His eyes were fixated on the screen as he hardly blinked.

“This is about to get serious!” he said to no one in particular, when his team heated up after a slow start. “This is going to be close. Wow, that shot was ridiculous. ... Let’s go!”
The running commentary continued until his team completed a come-from-behind win in the first game and swept the match. Following the victory, he quietly made his way to another screen to scout future opponents. Even during a meal break, Saffold clutched his phone to watch the action online.
“Before I got started with this, I was a fan,” Saffold said. “I wasn’t a corporation trying to just get into esports. ... So being able to come to these things and just watch game play, because as a gamer, I watch these guys, and I’m picking up tips.”
Tucker said it was rare to see an owner as involved as Saffold.
“He likes games,” Tucker said. “So it’s a lot different to come sit around all day with everybody.”
The four-member Rise Nation Call of Duty team has won three tournaments this season, including its most recent in Anaheim, where it took home $80,000 of a $200,000 prize pool.
Rise Nation's team is the favorite going into the Call of Duty World League Championship in Columbus, Ohio, in August, where the prize pool will increase to $1.5 million.
“Definitely want that world championship for Call of Duty,” Saffold said. “It puts us at another notch and just that premier level. ... We’ve got a pretty decent following, but I think grabbing a world championship would take us over the top.”
And other Rams want to get involved.
Saffold won’t reveal any names. He’s not ready to expand the business yet and doesn’t want to tip other teams to potential investors or owners when they could one day help him grow Rise Nation.
“At first we were thinking this was more of a hobby,” Saffold said. “But now it has kind of grown, and having more than one team and having players from all over the world has really been shocking thus far. We’re only five years into this.”
