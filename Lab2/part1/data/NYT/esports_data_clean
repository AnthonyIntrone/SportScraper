would

they

the
problem
cable

less
carry

fewer
people
paying
television
days
sports
teams
looking
receive
higher
fees
there
bargaining
tools

could
employ
make
owning
middlemen
worthwhile
a
big

company
like
fox
could
bundle
regional

channels
like

get
higher
rates
making
corresponding
increase
rights

fox
regional

channels
could
use
similar
tactic
bundling

but
amazon
doesn
leverage
may
matter
one
theory
amazon
could
take
games
cable
satellite
systems
make
exclusively
available
prime
members
there
two
problems
idea
first
fox
already
negotiated
agreements
22
regional
sports
networks
major
pay
carriers
those
contracts
honored
next
three
five
years
second
even
contracts
run
out
team
owners
may
want
limit
visibility
games
single
online
service
even
or
perhaps
especially
it
amazon
another
option
would
amazon
make
games
available
prime
subscribers
addition
local
cable
system
that
way
team
owners
don
lose
audience
but
cable
operators
sure
balk
they
likely
don
want
carry
regional
sports
network
prime
subscriber
could
get
less
month
and
pay
operators
refused
carry
networks
amazon
would
face
owners
unhappy
teams
lack
visibility
so
would
amazon
want
spend
much
business
could
come
undone
next
years
the
obvious
answer
amazon
expects
plans
create
disruption
streaming
could
become
dominant

business
next

could
mean
